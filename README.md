## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a basic GoodReads clone.

The main goals were to:

- Store book in an array
  - Use a constructor to create the books containing the following information: Title, Author, Page Number and whether it's been read
- Create a form to input new books in the array and display them
- The ability to remove books and update the array and display appropriately
- The ability to change a book's read status

In addition to the main goals to challenge myself I also added the following:

- UI change to reflect read status
- The ability to hide/show the form to add a book
- Storing and retrieving the array in localStorage

  #### Abilities Demonstrated

  - Using Objects and Constructors
  - Storing and Retrieving from localStorage
  - Research how to use various JS functions
  - Using vanilla CSS
  - JS Array Manipulation
  - JS Events
  - Good programming techniques
  - Browser developer tools
  - Staying within project scope
  - Basic Error Handling
  - Problem Solving

## Overview

This project was actually relatively simple compared to some of the previous ones I had completed. I took some extra time and actually planned out my project on paper as opposed to going straight to my computer. I feel like planning out on paper was helpful and I didn't have to visualize or think through my design or logic as I wrote it, I already had the fundamentals present, I just needed to string it together.

My biggest struggle with this project was finding time to complete it honestly. I started work at a second job and found it hard to find time to actually sit and program. I did use some of my time at work to plan which definitely helped a lot. I also worked hard to stay within the project scope. I had to reference and look back many times of what was required for the project, however that made it easier when I found time to work on it. I did still get some extra pieces that I wanted to include, however there were some items that I would have loved to implement if I had the time to do so.

#### Items I'd like to improve on for future projects:

- Good programming techniques
  - I feel like I've continue to improve in this respect, however since I was writing code, then coming back to it weeks later it did get difficult understanding what was going on.
  - I did start leaving comments and being slightly more picky when choosing variable and function names, however improvements can still be made
